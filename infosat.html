        <h1>About The Movie</h1>
        <p>
            Swatantrya Veer Savarkar is a 2024 Indian Hindi-language film on the life of Vinayak Damodar Savarkar. It is
            directed, co-written, and co-produced by Randeep Hooda, who also plays the titular role of Savarkar.
            It was released in theatres on 22 March 2024.

            The film has been criticised for distorting history and for promoting one-sided agenda, but received praises
            for its actors' performances.
